Installing MicroPython 
======================

To support the MicroPython PSoC6™ port installation the ``mpy-psoc6`` utility script is provided for Windows and
Linux.
You can easily download from your OS terminal with the following command:

.. tabs::

    .. group-tab:: Linux

        .. code-block:: bash

            curl -s -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/infineon/micropython/ports-psoc6/tools/psoc6/mpy-psoc6.sh > mpy-psoc6.sh 

        Add execution rights to the script:       
        
        .. code-block:: bash                
           
            chmod +x mpy-psoc6.sh 

    .. group-tab:: Windows
    
        Download the mpy-psoc6 utility script:

            .. code-block:: bash

                curl.exe -s -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/infineon/micropython/ports-psoc6/tools/psoc6/mpy-psoc6.cmd > mpy-psoc6.cmd


Find all the available commands and options by running the script with the command help:

.. tabs::

    .. group-tab:: Linux

        .. code-block:: bash

            ./mpy-psoc6.sh help

    .. group-tab:: Windows

            .. code-block:: bash
            
                ./mpy-psoc6.cmd help

.. _psoc6_quick_start:

Quick Start
------------

With the ``mpy-psoc6`` utility script downloaded, the fastest way to get you up and running with
micropython is to run the ``quick-start`` command of the script:

.. tabs::

    .. group-tab:: Linux
        
            .. code-block:: bash

                ./mpy-psoc6.sh quick-start

    .. group-tab:: Windows

            .. code-block:: bash
                
                mpy-psoc6.cmd quick-start

The command will take care of the following:

* Install all required software to work with MicroPython
* Deploy the latest version of MicroPython PSoC6 firmware on your board
* Launch Arduino Lab MicroPython IDE

This command is supporting the getting started tutorial for the first time. Once you get familiar
with MicroPython and its environment, the ``device-setup`` command will be more appropriate to
install MicroPython on PSoC6™ boards, and upgrade your device with the latest firmware. 

Device setup
-------------

In order to setup MicroPython in a PSoC6™ board, the ``device-setup`` command of the ``mpy-psoc6``
can be executed. Follow the instructions to select the target PSoC6™ board, and deploy the latest
MicropPython firmware version:

.. tabs::

    .. group-tab:: Linux
        
            .. code-block:: bash

                ./mpy-psoc6.sh device-setup

    .. group-tab:: Windows

            .. code-block:: bash
                
                mpy-psoc6.cmd device-setup


You can run any command any time you want to upgrade to the latest MicroPython firmware version.
This command will take care of the following steps:

* Download and install openocd, which is the software required to deploy a firmware file on PSoC6™ controllers
* Download the latest ``.hex`` file for your select board
* Deploy the latest version of MicroPython firmware on your board

Install a previous version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to setup the device with a previous firmware version, you can check the list of available release in the `GitHub release section <https://github.com/infineon/MicroPython/releases>`_. 

The ``device-setup`` command can as well assist you with this process. In this case the board and the desired
version need to be passed as arguments.

.. tabs::

    .. group-tab:: Linux
        
            .. code-block:: bash

                ./mpy-psoc6.sh device-setup CY8CPROTO-062-4343W v0.1.1

    .. group-tab:: Windows

            .. code-block:: bash
                
                mpy-psoc6.cmd device-setup CY8CPROTO-062-4343W v0.1.1

.. warning::
    
    Be sure to provide the board name as shown in the ``device-setup`` command when run in interactive mode.
    Equally, provide a valid tag existing in the release section with the format *v.x.y.z*. 
    No fail safe mechanisms or error verifications are (yet) implemented on the ``mpy-psoc6`` utility, and the script will fail to retrieve the necessary firmware file.

Direct binary flashing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Another alternative to program the board is to directly provide the binary file. The ``firmware-deploy`` command is providing this option. 
This commands is skipping all the tools download and installation, neither download the MicoPython firmware.
Therefore, it requires that `openocd <https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/design-support/software/free-and-open-source-software-foss/modustoolbox-foss-packages/?searchTerm=~%27openocd#!designsupport>`_ is already installed and available in the system path.
In exchange, it will be faster for batch flashing, or any situation where subsequent binary flashing needs to be performed.

The board needs to be specified, and the path and name of the ``.hex`` file:

.. tabs::

    .. group-tab:: Linux
        
            .. code-block:: bash

                ./mpy-psoc6.sh firmware-deploy CY8CPROTO-062-4343W pathtodir/mpy-psoc6_CY8CPROTO-062-4343W.hex

    .. group-tab:: Windows

            .. code-block:: bash
                
                mpy-psoc6.cmd firmware-deploy CY8CPROTO-062-4343W pathtodir/mpy-psoc6_CY8CPROTO-062-4343W.hex


Getting the firmware
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The binary *.hex* files are available in the `GitHub release section <https://github.com/infineon/MicroPython/releases>`_. 
All PSoC6™ firmware versions for each of the supported boards can be found there.

Other installation methods
--------------------------

Cypress Programmer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Alternatively, you can use directly flash the firmware binary file with the `Cypress Programmer
<https://softwaretools.infineon.com/tools/com.ifx.tb.tool.cypressprogrammer>`_ 
It allows to program the PSoC6™ microcontrollers family in a few clicks from your Windows,
Linux or Mac OS machine. 
Follow the instructions on the provided link to download and install the tool.

After that, select the downloaded MicroPython firmware *.hex* file to be deployed on the PSoC6™. Then, in
the upper menu, select the connected *Probe/Kit*, click on *Connect*, and finally click on *Program*.
The log section will show the progress and inform when the firmware deployment on the controller is completed.
