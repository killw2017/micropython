![](https://www.crowdsupply.com/img/040a/inkplate-6-angle-01_png_project-main.jpg)

Inkplate is a powerful, Wi-Fi enabled ESP32 based e-paper display â€“ recycled from a Kindle e-reader. Learn more about Inkplate on [official website](https://inkplate.io/). Inkplate6 was crowdfunded on [Crowd Supply Inkplate 6](https://www.crowdsupply.com/e-radionica/inkplate-6).

This board definition was based on [e-radionica/Inkplate-micropython](https://github.com/e-radionicacom/Inkplate-micropython) though the original software effort was by [tve](https://github.com/tve/micropython-inkplate6).

### Features

- Simple graphics class for monochrome use of the e-paper display
- Simple graphics class for 2 bits per pixel greyscale use of the e-paper display
- Support for partial updates
- Access to touch sensors
- Everything in pure python with screen updates virtually as fast as the Arduino C driver
- Bitmap drawing, although really slow
